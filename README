DESCRIPTION
-----------
ffserver-relay is responsible for starting ffserver and the capture program 
used to feed ffserver from the capture card.

Edit /etc/sunra/config.yml specifying the capture command and if
the output cannot be natively captured by ffmpeg, specify ffmpeg_pipe with:

ffmpeg_pipe: ffmpeg -v 0 -i - http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm"

This allows for the capture and relaying of capture via 3rd party code e.g.
bmdcapture.

Ensure that you have a working ffserver installation - it is advised that a 
version be built from source where possible. An example ffserver.conf file
is included in the config directory.

REQUIREMENTS
-------------
ffserver
ffmpeg

CONFIGURATION
-------------
configration of sunra-ffserver-relay is done via editing
/etc/sunra/relay.yml

There are two scenarios supported for capture - one where a seperate
program captures output from the video capture card and this is 
piped directly through ffmpeg, the other where ffmpeg captures the
audio and video directly. Please see the config file for examples.
